# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

For Project0 I developed a personal webpage which includes a Home tab, with a brief
description of myself, a Resume tab with some highlights of my career, an Interest tab with links to
books, movies, music and outdoors, and finally a Lets Talk tab with contact information.

Being my first webpage it was quite a chalenge to bring it all together.  Fortunately there's a vast
amount of documentation and links, and I was able to include all requirements.

Biggest milestones for me were understanding git, discovering flexbox and bootstrap.

The project contains the four html files, one .png, the style.scss (with its corresponding .map and .css)
a steps.md file (just a personal reminder).
